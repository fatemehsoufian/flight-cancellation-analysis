# Flight Cancellation Analysis

This project presents an in-depth analysis of U.S. domestic flight cancellations and delays from 2009 to 2018. Using PySpark for large-scale data processing, we explore patterns by airline, airport, season, and cancellation reason.

## 📊 Features

- Cancellation trends by airline and airport
- Monthly, seasonal, and yearly delay patterns
- Breakdown of cancellation reasons (Weather, Carrier, NAS, Security)
- Average departure delays by hour and airport

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python & PySpark
- Pandas & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
